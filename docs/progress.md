## Phase 4: Health Check & Observability

## Phase 5: Test Coverage Gaps

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Commit:** `feat/phase5-test-coverage`

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 5.1 scheduler_service tests | Done | 6 tests: job add/skip/remove logic, trigger_scheduled_scan |
| 5.2 webhook_service tests | Done | 6 tests: HMAC signature, event filter, wildcard, retry/give-up |
| 5.3 scan_service tests | Done | 4 tests: success path, missing subnet, scanner failure, state-change audit |
| 5.4 runner.py edge cases | Done | 14 tests: XML edge cases, reason->method mapping, build_nmap_args branches |
| 5.5 ips.py PATCH/DELETE tests | Done (PATCH only) | No DELETE endpoint exists on /ips; PATCH + history covered |
| 5.6 auth.py role-based tests | Done | Role enforcement implemented (require_role); admin-only key mgmt, operator writes |
| 5.7 classifier.py edge cases | Done | 11 total: unseen hosts, miss/quarantine independence, recovery paths |

Additional fixes made while writing tests:

- **fix:** scan trigger endpoint was sync but used `asyncio.create_task` -- crashed with "no running event loop". Made async.
- **fix:** scan_service accessed detached ORM attributes (`subnet.cidr`, `job.subnet_id`) after session close -- DetachedInstanceError with default expire_on_commit. Fields now captured inside session.
